# 239 - [滑动窗口最大值](https://leetcode.com/problems/sliding-window-maximum/)

## 题目描述
Given an array nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position. Return the max sliding window.

**Example:**
input:
	nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], and k = 3
output:
	[3,3,5,5,6,7] 

**Note:**
You may assume k is always valid, 1 ≤ k ≤ input array's size for non-empty array.

**Follow up:**
Could you solve it in linear time?
